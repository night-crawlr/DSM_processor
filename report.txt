question 1


answer

1)given that X is stored in 50,i loded it in r1 regisrter 
2)to make initial fibonacci numbers i kept it in r3,r4 as 1,1 respectively
3)I made a loop such that it computes r3+r4 and stores in r5
and shifts r3->r4,r4->r5 and go into loop again
4)the exit condition is if r5>x exit before exiting it shifts the register so r3 is my answer 
5)i moved r3 to r5 and stoped



question 2 we need to find gcd as every box has same num it must divide other two and should be max

answer

1)i kept 1st number in r1,2nd number in r2
2)i then found least and stored it in r1 by using label"sreehith"
3)implies big num is in r2,small num is in r1
4)we generally do hcf by computing remainder of r2 with r1
5)as we dont have division i computed it by doing repeated subtraction ie r2-r2,r2-2*r2,...
6)when it become negative i add r1 to it to make it positive
7)it is remainder i repeat process with r1 as remainder and r2 as old r1
8)it stops when subtraction become zero i stored it in r5

question 3 we need to sort it

answer

algoritham: first i find the largest number in it and its adress and swap the last element with this max element as i know adress of max i keep that last element in that adress now our world is confined to new problem of size=previoussize-1  i repeat process as when got to fist element it need not get sorted

1)i stored the size given in 190 location in register and also its copy
2)i stored 200 also 
3)i assumed max=0 but not yet it adress actually in programm i store it in r6
4)here loop is order of n square as i take initaly last element as max and iterate over the loop and find real max and replace with last element and next for new 
5)exit conditions when  no iterations are size
